# The only tutorial you need for Spring Boot WebSockets over Stomp, JWT Authentication/Authorization and one-on-one chat/events.
There is an overwhelming amount of information out there regarding WebSockets with Spring Boot and while there are a many useful articles, they usually
don't include all the use cases a developer might need. Before writing this, I had a hard time understanding how Spring Boot WebSockets could be used
in a stateless application (for example with an Angular/React front-end).

I have created this file to hopefully help people understand how to configure their spring boot backend to use websockets and Stomp from information I have
gathered here and there online while doing my own research on the topic.

This is a compilation of classes / tutorial file designed to make using Spring Boot WebSockets over Stomp understandable and easier.
